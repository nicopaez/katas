State Machine Kata
==================

There is a machine that operates in a sequence of states, lets say: stateA, stateB, StateC, StateD.

Part 1
------

The transitions between states is predefined in the following way:

* stateA > stateB
* stateB > stateC
* stateC > stateD
* stateD > stateA

All other transitions are considered invalid.

Create a object model to implement a machine with this states.
